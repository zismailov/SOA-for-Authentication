# Authentication as a Service in Ruby
[http://rubycas.github.io/](http://rubycas.github.io/)

The project is developed for learning purposes. It uses Ruby libraries to create a central authentication system that's based on the JASIG's CAS protocol. Through the use of object oriented design, you will be able to create a Sinatra application that implements the aforementioned protocol specification, along with a demonstration client application that will consume the server's services.

Source files on GitHub contain:

1. One Sinatra app for the API that acts as the authentication system;
2. Another Sinatra demo app that connects to the authentication system.
